        "\n\n# Split-half analysis for selecting the number of components\n\nIn this example, we will look at how we can use split-half analysis to select the number of PARAFAC components.\n\nThe idea of split-half analysis is that we want to find the same underlying patterns if we look at different representative subsets of the same data.\nTo accomplish this, we split the dataset in two equally sized non-overlapping pieces along one mode and fit a PARAFAC model to both pieces.\nThen, we compare the similarity of the factors in the other, non-split modes.\n\nGenerally, we would split the sample mode, but sometimes, it may also make sense to split other modes. For example,\nif we have a time series and expect the same patterns to be present in two subsequent periods, then we may split\nthe data along the temporal mode instead.\n"
