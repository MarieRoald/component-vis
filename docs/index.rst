ComponentVis is a Python package that helps you inspect your component models with insightful analysis and beautiful visualisations!
It is designed around the TensorLy API for PARAFAC/CP decompositions to fit seamlessly into your data analysis workflow.
With ComponentVis, you can combine metadata xarray DataArrays and Pandas DataFrames with your extracted factor matrices, turning them into rich DataFrames with meaningful indices.
To get started, take a look at the :ref:`examples` or the :ref:`API`.
